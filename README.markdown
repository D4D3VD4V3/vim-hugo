# vim-hugo

Blogging from the command line should not be tedious.

This script is intended to automate the process of creating
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) blog posts from within
[vim](http://www.vim.org/).

This is a complete rewrite of
[parkr/vim-jekyll](https://github.com/parkr/vim-jekyll)

                        you will be prompted to select a post or enter a title.

## Configuration
